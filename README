Web Crawler and Search Application

This project implements a web crawler and a search engine using Python. The crawler extracts content from a given starting URL and builds 
an index of the text content. The search engine uses the Whoosh library to perform efficient full-text searches, and a Flask web app provides an interface for querying the index.

Features

Search Index:
Uses the Whoosh library to create and manage a full-text search index.
Indexes the URL, title, teaser, and content of crawled pages.

Flask Web App:
